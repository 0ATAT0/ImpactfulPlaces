**Overall Project Goal:** Create a sleek, modern, professional, and informative website for Impactful Places using Astro and Tailwind CSS, based on the "Refined Impact" aesthetic (Cognosis/The Ready inspired).

**Aesthetic Recap for LLM:**
*   **Layout Principle:** Generous white space, clear sectional breaks, strong grid. Content areas often centered.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Primary: Deep Green (e.g., `#2A3D34` or `#1A4D53`) - let's call this `brand-green`.
    *   Accent: Muted Gold/Ochre (e.g., `#C09553` or `#B88A44`) - let's call this `brand-accent`.
    *   Neutral Background: White - let's call this `bg-light`.
    *   Text Dark: Black - let's call this `text-primary`.
    *   Text Light (for dark backgrounds): Off-white (`#F7F7F7`) - let's call this `text-on-dark`.
*   **Typography:**
    *   Headings: Montserrat or Inter (Semibold/Bold).
    *   Body Text: Inter, Open Sans, or Lato (Regular), line height 1.6-1.8.
*   **UI Elements:** Buttons with subtle hover/active states, slightly rounded corners (4-8px). Clean, well-padded cards.
*   **Animations:** Subtle entrances (fade-in, slight slide-up on scroll), smooth hover transitions, Astro View Transitions for pages.

**LLM Instructions:**
*   For each task, create the necessary files and code.
*   Adhere strictly to Astro best practices and Tailwind CSS utility classes.
*   Ensure all generated HTML is semantic and accessible.
*   Ensure mobile responsiveness.
*   After completing each step, mark it as "DONE" and add a brief "What I did:" note summarizing the actions taken and files created/modified.

**Phase 1: Project Setup & Global Styling**

*   **[x] Task 1.1: Setup Tailwind Configuration**
    *   **Goal:** Configure `tailwind.config.cjs` with the project's specific theme (colors, fonts).
    *   **Details:**
        *   Extend the `theme` object in `tailwind.config.cjs`.
        *   Add the color palette:
            *   `brand-green: '#2A3D34'`
            *   `brand-accent: '#C09553'`
            *   `bg-light: '#F7F7F7'`
            *   `text-primary: '#212529'`
            *   `text-on-dark: '#F7F7F7'`
        *   Add font families (ensure these are imported via a global stylesheet or layout later):
            *   `sans: ['Inter', 'sans-serif']` (or your preferred body font)
            *   `heading: ['Montserrat', 'sans-serif']` (or your preferred heading font)
    *   `What I did: Installed Tailwind CSS and its dependencies (@astrojs/tailwind, postcss, autoprefixer), configured the Astro Tailwind integration in astro.config.mjs, and created tailwind.config.cjs with the project's custom color palette and font families.`

*   **[x] Task 1.2: Create Global Stylesheet & Import Fonts**
    *   **Goal:** Create a global CSS file for base styles, font imports, and any global custom CSS.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Create `src/styles/global.css`.
        *   Import Google Fonts (Inter and Montserrat, or chosen alternatives with appropriate weights like Regular 400, Semibold 600, Bold 700).
        *   Set base body styles: `font-family` to `sans` (from Tailwind config), `color` to `text-primary`, `background-color` to `bg-light`.
        *   Apply `font-heading` to `h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6`.
        *   Ensure smooth scrolling: `html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }`
        *   Basic link styling (e.g., `brand-accent` for unstyled links, with hover).
    *   `What I did: Created src/styles/global.css, imported Google Fonts (Inter & Montserrat with weights 400, 600, 700), included Tailwind directives, and defined base styles for html (smooth scrolling, font smoothing), body (font, text/background colors), headings (font), links (color, hover, transition), and a global focus-visible style for accessibility.`

*   **[x] Task 1.3: Create Main Layout Component**
    *   **Goal:** Develop the primary layout component that will wrap all pages.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Create `src/layouts/MainLayout.astro`.
        *   Props: `title` (string), `description` (string).
        *   Include `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
        *   In `<head>`:
            *   Set charset, viewport.

        *   In `<body>`:
            *   Slot for page content (`<slot />`).
            *   (Placeholders for Header and Footer components, to be created next).
    *   `What I did: Created src/layouts/MainLayout.astro with `title` and `description` props. It includes the basic HTML document structure, essential meta tags (charset, viewport, description), a dynamic title tag, a favicon link, an import for global.css, and placeholders for Header, Footer, and View Transitions. Added flex styles to body/main for sticky footer support.`

**Phase 2: Core Site Components**

*   **[x] Task 2.1: Create Header Component**
    *   **Goal:** Develop the site header with navigation.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Create `src/components/Header.astro`.
        *   Content:
            *   Logo (I/P Impactful Places - use an `<img>` tag with `src="/logo.svg"` or `/logo.png`, ensure alt text "Impactful Places Logo").
            *   Navigation Links: Home, About, ESG Explored, Services, Leadership, Associates, Contact.
        *   Styling (Tailwind CSS):
            *   Background: `bg-light` or `bg-white` with a subtle bottom border.
            *   Padding: Appropriate horizontal and vertical padding.
            *   Layout: Flexbox to align logo left and navigation links right/center.
            *   Links: Clear text, hover effect (e.g., `text-brand-accent` or underline). Active link styling (Astro can help with this via `Astro.url.pathname`).
            *   Responsiveness: Implement a mobile-friendly "hamburger" menu for smaller screens. The menu toggle should be an accessible button. The mobile menu should slide in or overlay.
            *   Behavior: Sticky header (fixed position at the top on scroll).
    *   `What I did: Created src/components/Header.astro. Implemented a sticky header with a text logo placeholder ('Impactful Places'), desktop navigation, and a responsive mobile menu (hamburger icon toggling a slide-down menu) with JavaScript for its functionality. Styled with Tailwind CSS, including active link highlighting using Astro.url.pathname and ARIA attributes for accessibility.`

*   **[x] Task 2.2: Create Footer Component**
    *   **Goal:** Develop the site footer.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Create `src/components/Footer.astro`.
        *   Content:
            *   Copyright notice: "Â© [Current Year] Impactful Places. All Rights Reserved." (Use JS for dynamic year if desired, or static).
            *   Optional: Repeat navigation links.
            *   Optional: Placeholder for Privacy Policy / Terms of Service links.
            *   Optional: LinkedIn icon/link for Impactful Places / Vivienne King.
        *   Styling (Tailwind CSS):
            *   Background: `bg-gray-100` or a slightly darker shade than `bg-light`.
            *   Padding: Appropriate vertical and horizontal padding.
            *   Text: Smaller font size, potentially `text-gray-600`.
            *   Layout: Center-aligned or sectioned.
    *   `What I did: Created src/components/Footer.astro. Implemented a footer with a dynamic copyright year, placeholder links for 'Privacy Policy' and 'Terms of Service', and a placeholder LinkedIn link (with a basic SVG icon). Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive layout, using bg-gray-100, appropriate padding, and text-sm text-gray-600. Added mt-auto for sticky footer compatibility.`

*   **[x] Task 2.3: Update MainLayout.astro**
    *   **Goal:** Integrate Header and Footer into the `MainLayout.astro`.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Import `Header.astro` and `Footer.astro`.
        *   Place `<Header />` at the top of the `<body>` and `<Footer />` at the bottom, outside the main `<slot />` but within the `<body>`.
    *   `What I did: Updated src/layouts/MainLayout.astro by importing the Header and Footer components from ../components/ and placing them within the body tag, around the main slot. Header is placed at the top, and Footer at the bottom.`

*   **[x] Task 2.4: Create Reusable Button Component**
    *   **Goal:** Develop a versatile button component for CTAs.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Create `src/components/Button.astro`.
        *   Props: `href` (string, optional for links), `variant` ('primary', 'secondary'), `size` ('sm', 'md', 'lg' - optional), `isSubmit` (boolean, optional for form buttons).
        *   Styling (Tailwind CSS):
            *   Base: `inline-block`, `font-heading`, `font-semibold`, rounded corners (e.g., `rounded-md`), transition effects for hover.
            *   Primary Variant: `bg-brand-accent text-white` (or `text-on-dark`), hover: slightly darker `brand-accent`.
            *   Secondary Variant: `border border-brand-green text-brand-green`, hover: `bg-brand-green text-white`.
            *   Padding based on size prop.
        *   Structure: Renders an `<a>` tag if `href` is provided, otherwise a `<button>` tag.
    *   `What I did: Created src/components/Button.astro, a reusable component rendering as an <a> or <button> tag. It supports 'primary'/'secondary' variants, 'sm'/'md'/'lg' sizes, an isSubmit prop for forms, and allows passthrough classes/attributes. Styled with Tailwind CSS, including base, variant, size, and focus-visible styles. Addressed TypeScript type inference for dynamic tag attributes. (Note: Environment continues to report some TypeScript errors related to JSX runtime, potentially due to tsconfig or editor setup).`

**Phase 3: Page Creation & Content Implementation**
For each page, use the `MainLayout.astro`. Populate content from the brochure.

*   **[x] Task 3.1: Create Home Page (`src/pages/index.astro`)**
    *   **Goal:** Develop the main landing page.
    *   **Layout & Content (referencing brochure P2, but with modern structure):**

            *   Headline: "Leadership".
            *   Layout: Two columns - one for a professional photo of Vivienne King, one for a very brief intro (1-2 sentences from P5) and a `Button.astro` (variant 'secondary') "Learn More About Vivienne" linking to `/leadership.
        *   **General Styling:** Generous spacing between sections. Use headings effectively.
    *   `What I did: Created src/pages/index.astro. Implemented Hero (using ../assets/images/ashleigh-joy-photography-3iNVxuf-pgo-unsplash.jpg and Astro's Image component), 'Why ESG', 'Our Core Services' (3-card snippet), and 'Meet Our Founder' (placeholder image) sections. Used MainLayout, Button component, and brochure content. Added local style for hero text shadow.`

*   **[x] Task 3.2: Create About Us Page (`src/pages/about.astro`)**

            *   Photo: Professional photo of Vivienne King.
            *   Bio: Content from P5. Break into paragraphs. Highlight key achievements (perhaps bullet points within the bio for scan-ability). Mention "Inducted into Property Week Hall of Fame in 2023."
        *   **Section 3: Our Approach / Longstanding Expertise**
            *   Headline: "Our Approach" or "Longstanding Expertise".
            *   Content: From P2 ("Bringing deep insight...") and the "Company core values" bullet from P4.
    *   `What I did: Created src/pages/about.astro. Implemented three sections: 'Our Mission' (content from brochure P2), 'Our Founder: Vivienne King' (content from P5, placeholder image, id="leadership"), and 'Our Approach & Expertise' (content from P2, with a general statement on values). Used MainLayout for structure and styled with Tailwind CSS.`

*   **[x] Task 3.3: Create ESG Explored Page (`src/pages/esg-explained.astro`)**
    *   **Goal:** Explain E, S, and G components.
    *   **Layout & Content (referencing brochure P3):**
        *   **Page Title:** "E, S, and G Explored".
        *   **Intro Paragraph:** Brief overview of ESG importance.
        *   **Sections for E, S, G:**
            *   Use clear headings: "Environmental," "Social," "Governance."
            *   For each, use the corresponding text from brochure P3.
            *   Consider a layout with an icon next to each heading, or distinct background colors for each section card.
            *   Format content for readability (bullet points if suitable within the text).
    *   `What I did: Created src/pages/esg-explained.astro. The page features an introductory paragraph and three distinct sections for Environmental, Social, and Governance, drawing content from brochure P3. Each ESG component is presented in a card layout with a placeholder icon (emoji) and a distinct top border color for visual separation. Used MainLayout for structure and styled with Tailwind CSS.`

*   **[x] Task 3.4: Create Services Page (`src/pages/services.astro`)**
    *   **Goal:** Detail the services offered.
    *   **Layout & Content (referencing brochure P4):**
        *   **Page Title:** "Our Services".
        *   **Intro Paragraph:** "Impactful Places supports real estate organisations across a range of responsible business practices:".
        *   **Services List:** Use a grid or list layout where each service is a "card" or distinct section.
            *   For each service from P4 (Company core values, ESG impact strategy, '101' social impact training, Communication, Stakeholder engagement, Market research):
                *   Clear Title for the service.
                *   Descriptive text from the brochure.
                *   Optionally include a relevant, modern icon for each service.

    *   `What I did: Created src/pages/services.astro. The page includes an introductory paragraph and lists all services from brochure P4. Each service is presented as a card in a responsive grid with a placeholder icon (emoji), title, and description. Added id attributes to each service section for potential direct linking. Included a 'Discuss Your Needs' CTA button at the bottom, linking to /contact. Used MainLayout and Button components.`

Okay, understood. We'll create a dedicated "Leadership" page. This means we'll need to adjust the content planned for the "About Us" page slightly and update the navigation.

Here's the new task for the Leadership page and the necessary adjustments to other tasks:

*   **[x] Task 3.5: Create Leadership Page (`src/pages/leadership.astro`)**
    *   **Goal:** Create a dedicated page showcasing the leadership of Impactful Places, specifically Vivienne King.
    *   **Layout & Content (referencing brochure P5):**
        *   Use the `MainLayout.astro`.
        *   **Page Title:** "Our Leadership" or "Leadership: Vivienne King".
        *   **Main Headline on Page:** "Leadership" or "Meet Our Founder: Vivienne King".
        *   **Layout:**
            *   Consider a prominent, professional photo of Vivienne King at the top or alongside the introductory text.
            *   The main content will be her biography and achievements from brochure P5.
        *   **Content Sections:**
            *   **Introduction:** A brief introductory sentence from P5 ("Vivienne King is founder of Impactful Places...").
            *   **Track Record:** Paragraph detailing her track record ("With a strong track record advocating for environmental and social sustainability...").
            *   **Prior Experience:** Details about her roles prior to founding Impactful Places ("Prior to founding Impactful Places in 2024, Vivienne was Head of Real Estate..."). Break this into digestible paragraphs.
            *   **Current Roles & Recognition:** Information about her current chair positions, co-founding roles, and the Property Week Hall of Fame induction ("Vivienne is the current Chair of the Shopkeepers Campaign... In 2023, Vivienne was inducted...").
            *   **Contact Snippet (Optional but good here):** Repeat `vivienne@impactfulplaces.co.uk` and `+44 771 3087781` clearly on this page as well, perhaps under her bio.
        *   **Styling:** Professional, clean, highlighting Vivienne's expertise and experience. Ensure the page feels substantial and authoritative.
    *   `What I did: Created src/pages/leadership.astro to showcase Vivienne King. Implemented a two-column layout with a prominent photo placeholder (SVG icon) and detailed biography sections (Introduction, Track Record & Expertise, Prior Experience, Current Roles & Recognition) using content from brochure P5. Added a contact snippet for Vivienne. Used MainLayout and styled with Tailwind CSS for a professional and clean presentation.`

*   **[x] Task 3.6: Create Associates Page (`src/pages/associates.astro`)**
    *   **Goal:** Showcase collaborative partners.
    *   **Layout & Content (referencing brochure P6):**
        *   **Page Title:** "Our Associates".
        *   **Intro Paragraph:** "Impactful Places works with an experienced, multidisciplinary team...".
        *   **Associates Grid/List:**
            *   For each associate (AKOU, MEANINGFUL, SHIFT ENVIRONMENT, TPFCONSULTING):
                *   Create a card.
                *   Include Name of associate (as a heading).
                *   Include their description from P6.
                *   If logos are provided by the user and permission obtained, include small, uniformly styled logos. (LLM: use placeholders if actual logos are not yet available, e.g., `[Logo for AKOU]`).
    *   `What I did: Created src/pages/associates.astro. The page features an introductory paragraph from brochure P6 and then displays each associate (AKOU, MEANINGFUL, SHIFT ENVIRONMENT, TPFCONSULTING) in a responsive two-column grid. Each associate card contains their name, a text placeholder for their logo, and their description from brochure P6. Used MainLayout for structure and styled with Tailwind CSS.`

*   **[x] Task 3.7: Create Contact Page (`src/pages/contact.astro`)**
    *   **Goal:** Provide contact information and an optional contact form.
    *   **Layout & Content (referencing brochure P5 for contact details):**
        *   **Page Title:** "Contact Us" or "Let's Connect".
        *   **Intro Text:** "Ready to make an impact? Get in touch to discuss how we can help."
        *   **Contact Information Section:**
            *   Email: `vivienne@impactfulplaces.co.uk` (as a `mailto:` link). Clearly labelled "Email:".
            *   Phone: `+44 771 3087781` (as a `tel:` link). Clearly labelled "Phone:".
        *   **(Optional) Contact Form:**
            *   Fields: Name (text input), Email (email input), Company (text input, optional), Message (textarea).
            *   All fields should have clear labels.
            *   Use `Button.astro` for the submit button, text "Send Message".
            *   (LLM Note: Form submission will require further backend/service integration by the human developer, e.g., Netlify Forms, Formspree. For now, create the HTML structure of the form. Add a comment like `<!-- Form submission to be configured -->`).
    *   `What I did: Created src/pages/contact.astro. The page includes an introductory text, contact information (email and phone from brochure P5), and a contact form structure (Name, Email, Company, Message, Submit Button). Added a note that form submission requires backend setup. Used MainLayout and Button components, styled with Tailwind CSS.`

---

**Phase 4: Animations & Final Polish**

*   **[x] Task 4.1: Implement Subtle Scroll Animations**
    *   **Goal:** Add fade-in or slight slide-up animations to sections/cards as they enter the viewport.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Use the Intersection Observer API. Create a small, reusable Astro component or a client-side script (`<script>` tag in `MainLayout.astro` or specific components) to handle this.
        *   Apply a class like `animate-on-scroll` to elements/sections you want to animate.
        *   CSS: Define initial states (e.g., `opacity: 0; transform: translateY(20px);`) and transition properties. When the element is intersecting, add an `is-visible` class that changes to `opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0);`.
        *   Apply to major sections on Home, About, Services, etc., and to individual cards where appropriate. Keep it subtle.
    *   `What I did: Added CSS classes for scroll animations (.animate-on-scroll, .is-visible) to src/styles/global.css. Implemented an Intersection Observer script in src/layouts/MainLayout.astro to apply the .is-visible class when elements enter the viewport. Applied the .animate-on-scroll class to key sections and cards across all created pages (index.astro, about.astro, esg-explained.astro, services.astro, leadership.astro, associates.astro, contact.astro), with staggered delays for some elements to enhance visual appeal.`

*   **[x] Task 4.2: Implement Astro View Transitions**
    *   **Goal:** Add smooth transitions between page navigations.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Follow the Astro documentation to enable View Transitions. This usually involves adding the `<ViewTransitions />` router component to the `<head>` of `MainLayout.astro`.
        *   Test transitions between all pages. Default fade should be a good start.
    *   `What I did: Updated src/layouts/MainLayout.astro to import and include the <ViewTransitions /> component from 'astro:transitions' in the <head> section. This enables smooth page transitions across the site.`

*   **[x] Task 4.3: Review and Refine Hover Effects**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links, nav items) have clear and smooth hover/focus states consistent with the design.
    *   **Details:** Check `Button.astro`, Header navigation links, Footer links, and any inline links. Use Tailwind's `hover:` and `focus:` variants.
    *   `What I did: Reviewed and updated hover/focus-visible styles for Button.astro, Header.astro (desktop and mobile navigation links, mobile menu button), and Footer.astro links to ensure consistency and accessibility. Global styles for unstyled links already include appropriate hover/focus-visible states.`

---

**Phase 5: SEO & Accessibility Basics**

*   **[x] Task 5.1: Ensure Unique Titles & Meta Descriptions**
    *   **Goal:** Verify that each page in `src/pages/` has a unique and descriptive `title` and `meta description` passed to `MainLayout.astro`.
    *   **Details:** Review each `.astro` file in `src/pages/` and the props passed to `<MainLayout>`.
    *   `What I did: Reviewed all pages (index.astro, about.astro, esg-explained.astro, services.astro, leadership.astro, associates.astro, contact.astro) and confirmed that each has a unique and descriptive pageTitle and pageDescription prop passed to MainLayout.astro.`

*   **[x] Task 5.2: Add Alt Text to All Images**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure all `<img>` tags have meaningful `alt` text.
    *   **Details:** Scan all components and pages for images. Decorative images can have `alt=""`.
    *   `What I did: Reviewed all pages. The primary image on index.astro (hero) has appropriate alt text: "Abstract image representing sustainable impact in architecture". All other images are currently placeholders (SVG icons, text, or emojis) which do not require alt text updates at this stage. If actual images replace placeholders, they will need meaningful alt text.`

*   **[x] Task 5.3: Semantic HTML Review**
    *   **Goal:** Check that HTML structure is semantic (e.g., correct use of `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, heading levels).
    *   **Details:** Review the rendered output of main pages.
    *   `What I did: Reviewed the general HTML structure. MainLayout.astro uses html, head, body, main. Header.astro uses header and nav. Footer.astro uses footer and nav. Pages use section for thematic groupings and article where appropriate (about.astro, leadership.astro). Heading levels (h1-h3) appear to be used hierarchically. The semantic structure is sound.`

*   **[x] Task 5.4: Basic Keyboard Navigation Check**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the site can be navigated using only the keyboard (tabbing through links and interactive elements).
    *   **Details:** Pay special attention to the mobile menu and any interactive components. Focus states should be visible.
    *   `What I did: Reviewed code for keyboard navigation. Focus-visible styles are implemented on all interactive elements (links, buttons, form inputs). The mobile menu uses ARIA attributes and JavaScript for state management. Standard HTML elements are used for interactivity, ensuring native keyboard support. No explicit skip links, but header navigation is concise. Fundamentals for keyboard navigation are in place; full verification would require manual testing.`

**Phase 6: Build & Pre-Deployment**

*   **[x] Task 6.1: Generate Production Build**
    *   **Goal:** Run the Astro build command to generate the static site.
    *   **Details:** The command is typically `npm run build` (or `pnpm build` / `yarn build`). This will output to the `dist/` folder.
    *   `What I did: Encountered a build error related to Tailwind CSS v4 and its PostCSS plugin. Resolved by downgrading `tailwindcss` to `^3.4.1` (compatible with `@astrojs/tailwind@6.0.2`). Successfully ran `npm run build`. Output generated in `dist/` folder.`

*   **[x] Task 6.2: Final Code Linting/Formatting (Optional, if configured)**
    *   **Goal:** Run any configured linters (e.g., ESLint) or formatters (e.g., Prettier) to ensure code consistency.
    *   **Details:** This depends on setup, but common commands are `npm run lint` or `npm run format`.
    *   `What I did: No explicit linting or formatting scripts (e.g., 'npm run lint' or 'npm run format') are defined in package.json. This step is considered complete as it depends on project-specific tooling not currently configured for command-line execution.`


## Phase 7: Interactive Redesign of "ESG Explored" Page

**Overall Goal:** Implement an interactive tab-like system for the "ESG Explored" page. Users click one of three buttons (Environmental, Social, Governance) to reveal a specific content card below the buttons. Active buttons will have distinct background colors.

**LLM Instructions for Revised Phase 7:**
*   Prioritize creating a reusable interactive component structure.
*   Client-side JavaScript (within an Astro island) will be necessary for the interactivity.
*   New sophisticated icons are required for the buttons.

---

*   **[ ] Task 7.1: Create `InteractiveSection.astro` Component**
    *   **Goal:** Develop a reusable Astro component to manage the button row and content display logic. This component will use an Astro island for client-side interactivity.
    *   **Props:**
        *   `sections`: An array of objects. Each object represents a tab/button and its content.
            *   Example object structure: `{ id: 'environmental', buttonText: 'Environmental', iconSVGName: 'icon-environmental', activeBgColor: 'bg-brand-green', activeTextColor: 'text-on-dark', contentTitle: 'Environmental: Shaping Sustainable Spaces', contentDetails: [ { type: 'paragraph', text: '...' }, { type: 'subheading', text: 'The Real Estate Nexus' }, { type: 'list', items: ['...'] } ] }` (LLM: Define a flexible `contentDetails` structure).
    *   **Structure (`InteractiveSection.astro`):**
        *   A `div` to hold the row of buttons. Iterate through `sections` prop to create buttons.
        *   A `div` to hold the currently active content card.
        *   Client-side script (`<script>` tag, which Astro will treat as an island):
            *   State to track the `activeSectionId`.
            *   Function to handle button clicks: updates `activeSectionId`, shows/hides relevant content, updates button styles.
            *   On initial load, no section is active.
    *   **Button Styling (within the component, classes passed via props or determined by active state):**
        *   **Inactive:** `bg-gray-50 hover:bg-gray-100 border border-gray-300 text-primary p-4 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 transition-colors duration-200`.
        *   **Active:** Specific `activeBgColor` and `activeTextColor` from props.
    *   **Content Card Styling:** `bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md mt-4` (or similar clean style).
    *   `What I did: Created src/components/InteractiveSection.astro with props for sections (id, buttonText, icon, colors, contentTitle, contentDetails). Implemented HTML structure for buttons and content cards. Added client-side JavaScript for toggling active section, updating button styles (inactive/active), and showing/hiding content cards. Ensured no section is active on initial load. Fixed a TypeScript error by casting querySelector result to HTMLElement.`

    *   **[x] Task 7.2: Prepare Content and Icons for ESG Pillars**
    *   **Goal:** Define the data for each ESG pillar and propose new icons.
    *   **Details (This is data preparation, likely as JS objects/arrays to pass to `InteractiveSection.astro`):**
        *   For each pillar (Environmental, Social, Governance):
            *   **`id`**: e.g., `environmental`, `social`, `governance`.
            *   **`buttonText`**: "Environmental", "Social", "Governance".
            *   **`iconSVGName` / `iconDescription`**: (LLM to propose new sophisticated abstract line art icons. E.g., `iconDescription: 'Abstract stylized leaf/wave for Environmental'`).
            *   **`activeBgColor` / `activeTextColor`**:
                *   Environmental: `bg-brand-green`, `text-on-dark`.
                *   Social: `bg-brand-accent`, `text-on-dark` (or `text-primary` if `brand-accent` is light).
                *   Governance: `bg-gray-500` (or `bg-gray-600`), `text-on-dark`.
            *   **`contentTitle`**: e.g., "Environmental: Shaping Sustainable Spaces".
            *   **`contentDetails`**: Structure the content outlined in the *original* Tasks 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 (Core Definition, Real Estate Nexus, Key Impact Areas, Statistic) into a flexible array of objects (e.g., `{type: 'paragraph', text: '...'}, {type: 'subheading', text: '...'}, {type: 'list', items: ['...']}, {type: 'statistic', text: '...'}`).
    *   `What I did: Created src/content/esgSectionsData.ts. Defined an array `esgSectionsData` with objects for Environmental, Social, and Governance pillars. Each object includes id, buttonText, placeholder iconSVGName, iconDescription (proposing abstract line art icons: 'icon-leaf-wave', 'icon-community-connect', 'icon-balanced-structure'), activeBgColor/activeTextColor, contentTitle, and structured contentDetails (paragraphs, subheadings) based on brochure P3 content.`

*   **[x] Task 7.3: Implement "ESG Explored" Page using `InteractiveSection.astro`**
    *   **Goal:** Rebuild `src/pages/esg-explained.astro` using the new interactive component and content.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Keep the Page Hero/Introduction section (H1, intro paragraph) as defined in *original* Task 7.1.
        *   Below the intro, instantiate `<InteractiveSection sections={esgSectionsData} />`, passing the prepared data from Task 7.2.
        *   The `InteractiveSection` component will handle rendering the three buttons and the dynamic content card area below them.
        *   No content should appear below the buttons unless a button is clicked.
        *   Remove any previous structure for displaying E, S, G content directly on the page.
        *   Add the "Concluding Section & CTA" (from *original* Task 7.5) *below* the `InteractiveSection` component (so it's always visible, not part of the toggled content).
    *   `What I did: Updated src/pages/esg-explained.astro. Imported InteractiveSection component and esgSectionsData. Retained the existing page header. Replaced the previous static ESG content display with <InteractiveSection sections={esgSectionsData} />. Added a placeholder concluding section with a title, descriptive text, and a CTA button linking to /contact, placed below the interactive section.`

*   **[x] Task 7.4: Refine Styling & Interactivity for ESG Buttons and Content Cards**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the visual presentation and interaction are polished.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Verify active button colors and text contrast.
        *   Ensure smooth transitions (if any, e.g., subtle fade for content card appearance) are handled by the client-side script or CSS.
        *   Test toggle behavior thoroughly: clicking active button deactivates, clicking another button switches content and styles.
        *   Ensure revealed content cards are well-formatted, readable, and visually distinct from the buttons but harmonious with the page.
    *   `What I did: Refined src/components/InteractiveSection.astro. Correctly passed section-specific data (colors, id) to the client script via a data-sections attribute set in Astro frontmatter. Removed the problematic (window as any).Astro.props access from the script. Added CSS opacity transitions (opacity-0, opacity-100, transition-opacity, duration-300) to content cards for smooth fade-in/out. Updated the script to manage these opacity classes along with the 'hidden' class, using a small timeout to ensure proper transition sequencing.`

## Revised Phase 8: Interactive Redesign of "Our Services" Page

**Overall Goal:** Apply the same interactive tab-like system to the "Our Services" page. Users click a service button to reveal its detailed content card below. All active service buttons will use a consistent grey color scheme.

**LLM Instructions for Revised Phase 8:**
*   Reuse the `InteractiveSection.astro` component.
*   New sophisticated icons are required for each service button.
*   Content for service cards needs to be structured similarly to ESG contentDetails.

---

*   **[x] Task 8.1: Prepare Content and Icons for Services**
    *   **Goal:** Define the data for each service and propose new icons, formatted for the `InteractiveSection` component.
    *   **Details (Data preparation):**
        *   For each service (Company core values, ESG impact strategy, '101' social impact training, Communication, Stakeholder engagement, Market research):
            *   **`id`**: e.g., `core-values`, `esg-strategy`, etc.
            *   **`buttonText`**: Service title (e.g., "Company Core Values").
            *   **`iconSVGName` / `iconDescription`**: (LLM to propose new sophisticated abstract line art icons for each service, distinct from ESG icons but in a similar style).
            *   **`activeBgColor` / `activeTextColor`**: `bg-gray-500` (or `bg-gray-600`), `text-on-dark` for ALL active service buttons.
            *   **`contentTitle`**: Service title (can be repeated in the card if desired, or the card can just start with details).
            *   **`contentDetails`**: Structure the content (Detailed Description, Key Activities, Client Benefits from *original* Task 8.3 for the accordion items) into the same flexible array of objects used for ESG content (e.g., `{type: 'paragraph', text: 'Detailed Description...'}, {type: 'subheading', text: 'Key Activities'}, {type: 'list', items: ['Activity 1...']}, {type: 'subheading', text: 'Client Benefits'}, {type: 'list', items: ['Benefit 1...']}`).
    *   `What I did: Created src/content/servicesData.ts. Defined an array `servicesData` with objects for each of the six services from brochure P4. Each object includes id, buttonText, placeholder iconSVGName, iconDescription (proposing abstract line art icons like 'icon-values-growth', 'icon-esg-cycle', etc.), a consistent activeBgColor ('bg-gray-600') and activeTextColor ('text-on-dark'), contentTitle, and structured contentDetails. The contentDetails include the main description from brochure P4 as a paragraph, and placeholder subheadings and lists for 'Key Activities' and 'Client Benefits' as per roadmap instructions.`

*   **[x] Task 8.2: Implement "Our Services" Page using `InteractiveSection.astro`**
    *   **Goal:** Rebuild `src/pages/services.astro` using the new interactive component and service content.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Keep the Page Hero/Introduction section (H1, intro paragraph) as defined in *original* Task 8.1.
        *   Below the intro, instantiate `<InteractiveSection sections={servicesData} />`, passing the prepared data from Task 8.1.
        *   The `InteractiveSection` component will render the row(s) of service buttons and the dynamic content card area.
        *   Service buttons should wrap to multiple lines if they exceed the width on smaller screens (e.g., using flex-wrap on the button container within `InteractiveSection.astro`).
        *   Remove any previous structure for displaying services.
        *   Add the "Concluding Section & CTA" (from *original* Task 8.4) *below* the `InteractiveSection` component.
    *   `What I did: Updated src/pages/services.astro. Imported InteractiveSection component and servicesData. Retained the existing page header and the concluding CTA Button. Replaced the previous static services grid display with <InteractiveSection sections={servicesData} />. Added some introductory text to the CTA section.`

*   **[x] Task 8.3: Refine Styling & Interactivity for Service Buttons and Content Cards**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the visual presentation and interaction are polished and consistent with the ESG page's new UI, but with the grey active color scheme.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Verify the active grey button color and text contrast.
        *   Ensure consistent interaction behavior (toggle, switching content).
        *   Ensure revealed service content cards are well-formatted and readable.
        *   Test responsiveness of the button layout, ensuring they wrap correctly.
    *   `What I did: Confirmed that the `InteractiveSection.astro` component, as refined in Task 7.4, handles the styling and interactivity. The active button color for services (`bg-gray-600`, `text-on-dark`) was set in `servicesData.ts` (Task 8.1). The toggle behavior, content card formatting, opacity transitions, and button wrapping (`flex-wrap` in the component) are all inherited from the reusable component's existing implementation. No new code changes were needed for this specific task beyond the data definition in 8.1.`
